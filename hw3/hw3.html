    <h1>Homework 3</h1>
    <h3>In this lesson I learned how to display images in different projections. Projections are coordinate reference systems; different projections provide different reference positions of the earth. Below are nine different projections displaying how they can varry. To do this in QGIS you click on the bottom right portion of the screen where a globe icon sits. From there a window opens that allows you to search and apply different preloaded projections in the QGIS software.</h3>
    <h2>WSG84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the map appears as a cylindrical mercator. It is conformal at the equator, preserving direction and shape. The map appears even but there is distortion in distance and area.</h3>

    <h2>Atioff Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the map appears as a type of azimuthal. All of shape, area, distance, and direction are distorted to provide a globe-like appearance.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the map appears as a mercator. It preserves shape, however it distorts direction, area, and distance.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkle I Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the map appears as a type of azimuthal.</h3>
