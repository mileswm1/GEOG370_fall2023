    <h1>Homework 8</h1>
    <h3>In this lesson I learned how to use different types of geoprocessing tools in QGIS. For this analysis, I chose to create buffers around the watershed that is being polluted from upstream dumpsites in Burlington. These dump sites have caused the water flowing in the Haw River, which supplies Pittsboro's water, to be some of the most toxic water in the country. I have also included the flood zones around the Haw River and it's nearby tributaries to indicate affected parcels and protected land areas in the event of a flood, answering the real world question "What parcels of land in Chatham County would be affected by the breach of toxins in the event of a flood?" All data has been accessed through Chatham County's GIS database.</h3>
    <h2>Map of Chatham County Watershed</h2>
    <h3>This map demonstrates a base reference of the different contents being used to analyze the affect of contaminated water.</h3>

    <h2>Map of Chatham County Watershed with Buffers</h2>
    <h3>This map is a finished analysis of the range in which polluted water will seep into ground water based on a one year residence time. The haw river data and adjectcent tributaries have been unioned and dissovlved to more easily analyze affected areas. In the event of a flood the highly contaminated Haw River water will directly affect the areas that lie beneath the grey buffered region as well as the parcels indicated in a brown tint. The buffer extends a kilometer out from the river due to surface ground water's residence time and ability to move quickly through the water cycle. Surround tributaries within this area that could backflow in the event of a flood have a 100 meter buffer. These buffers are then intersected with the parcels of land that lie within the buffer. This elements with all joined to provide a consistent and accurate scope. There is also a water main within this area near pittsboro, which in the event of a flood has a higher chance of being damaged and thus contaminated.</h3>
