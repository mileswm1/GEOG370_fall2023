    <h2>Natural Break NY Education Choropleth</h2>
    <h3>This map shows a choropleth in a natural break of the New York population. The choropleth shows the numeric population of people 25 years or older that have obtained a bachelors degree or higher per county. The high density educated areas lie mostly within the city limits of New York City due to it's incredibly high population.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Count NY Education Choropleth</h2>
    <h3>This map shows a choropleth in a equal count break of the New York population. The choropleth shows the numeric population at 25 years or older that has obtained a bachelors degree or higher per county. This natural break map has been added to show a map that accounts for the lesser populated, more rural parts of New York thus giving the education ratio a greater representation.</h3>
